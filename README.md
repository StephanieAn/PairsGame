### Details
During this project, I've encontered some little issues as how to set a time to display the card, how to click on two cards at a time and how to make it DRY. 

1. How to set a time to display the card: To be honest it was the first time than I used the ```setTimeout()``` method. It's usefull ! 

2. How to click on two cards at a time: It had taken more time to solve this problem. The real issue was to understant the way the code works when we selected a card how it know this card and not another was used. I think that I've improved my understanding of JavaScript (That's the purpose of this project :shushing_face: :wink:).

3. How to make it DRY:Not an easy one when we're working on it since a few days. After a little break, I take the time to look at it and see what can be improved. So the ```If``` condition were modified to be on one code line or don't use an ```else``` element.
